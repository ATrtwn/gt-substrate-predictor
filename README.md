## 🧬 Predicting Glycosyltransferase-Substrate Pairs Using Machine Learning

### Project Overview
Glycosylation is a fundamental biochemical process where a sugar is transferred to another metabolite by glycosyltransferase (GT) enzymes. Predicting which GT can glycosylate a specific substrate is challenging due to variability in acceptor-binding pockets. 

This project aims to develop machine learning models that predict GT-substrate binding using protein and substrate embeddings, with optional integration of AlphaFold2 structural features. The goal is to enable targeted modification of bioactive metabolites and pharmaceuticals.

### 🎯 Key Objectives
- Build representations of GT proteins (ProtT5, ProstT5) and substrates (ChemBERTa, KPGT).
- Train and evaluate ML models (Logistic Regression, FNN, GNN) to classify GT-substrate pairs.
- Evaluate models on stratified splits:
  - **C1:** Both GT and substrate seen during training
  - **C2:** Novel GT or substrate
  - **C3:** Both GT and substrate unseen
- Integrate structural insights from AlphaFold2 (optional).
- Benchmark against baseline models and existing prediction tools.
